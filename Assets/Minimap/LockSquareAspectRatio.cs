 * Locks a camera to a square aspect ratio.
 * Since the screen is likely non-square, all relative references (including viewport coordinates)
 * will be stretched - which is bad for viewports that were intended to show only a square area (minimaps,  etc.)
 * We compensate by finding what percentage of the screen width is necessary to create a square area, then
 * updating the camera viewport rectangle with each frame.
